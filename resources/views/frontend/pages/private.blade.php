        <h4>Preparation and suggestion for yoga</h4>
        <p>To prepare for your first yoga class find out about the standard practices.For example, you may need your own
            yoga mat before taking yoga class. Here are a few ways that you can prepare for your first yoga class</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review information about the yoga class</strong>:Call the studio or
                check out its website for details about the class level and any prerequisites.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid eating for several hours before class</strong>: Yoga instructors
                generally recommend that you do not eat right before class due to the extensive twisting and bending
                involved in yoga practice. However, this is entirely up to you and will be based on knowledge of your
                own body and whether you are affected by eating prior to physical activity.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Limit the use of scented lotions, perfumes and cologne</strong>: Yoga
                classes can cause you to sweat, which releases these scents into the air and can be problematic for
                other class participants who may be allergic to or distracted by these aromas.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dress comfortably for yoga class</strong>: You might invest in yoga
                attire or simply wear comfortable athletic clothing. Avoid wearing overly baggy clothing, such as a
                t-shirt, because you might find yourself upside down with the t-shirt covering your face for extensive
                periods of time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wear layers in cold weather</strong>: To keep your muscles warm, you
                might start the yoga class wearing several layers and can remove them during class once your muscles are
                warm.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bring a towel.</strong>Depending on the demands of the yoga class and
                how much you exert yourself, you may sweat a lot.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inform the yoga instructor of injuries or physical
                    limitations.</strong>This is useful information for the instructor who may then suggest
                modifications for yoga poses and positions. It is also a courteous gesture so that a yoga instructor
                understands why you are not participating in some of the yoga poses.
            </li>
        </ul>
